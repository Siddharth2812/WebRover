# Overview
WebRover is an AI-powered web agent that combines autonomous browsing with advanced research capabilities. While maintaining its core ability to automate web tasks, version 2.0 introduces sophisticated research workflows including multi-source analysis, academic paper generation, and deep topic exploration. The system intelligently routes queries between task automation and research modes, providing a versatile tool for both quick actions and comprehensive research.

# Motivation
While traditional web automation tools excel at task execution, and search engines help with information retrieval, there's a growing need for tools that can handle both while specializing in deep research workflows. WebRover bridges this gap by offering task automation alongside intelligent research capabilities, with a particular focus on comprehensive information gathering, analysis, and synthesis. This dual-purpose approach aims to transform how we interact with web content, making both task execution and research more efficient and thorough.

## Architecture

The system is built on a modern tech stack with three distinct agent types, each powered by:

1. **State Management**
   - LangGraph for maintaining agent state
   - Handles complex navigation flows and decision making
   - Structured workflow management

2. **Browser Automation**
   - Playwright for reliable web interaction
   - Custom element detection and interaction system
   - Automated navigation and content extraction

3. **Content Processing**
   - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline
   - Vector store integration for efficient information storage
   - PDF and webpage content extraction
   - Automatic content structuring and organization

4. **AI Decision Making**
   - Multiple LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude)
   - Context-aware navigation
   - Self-review mechanisms
   - Structured output generation

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hrithikkoduri18/WebRover.git
   cd WebRover
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

   Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```
   Windows:
   ```bash
   (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
   ```

3. Set Python version for Poetry
   ```bash
   poetry env use python3.12
   ```

4. Activate the Poetry shell:
   For Unix/Linux/MacOS:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   # or manually
   source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
   ```
   For Windows:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   # or manually
   & (poetry env info --path)\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

6. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langchain_api_key"
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
   LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your_project_name"
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
   ```

7. Run the backend:

   Make sure you are in the backend folder

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000 
    ```

   For Windows User:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
    ```

8. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and make sure you are in the WebRover folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`

For mac users: 

Try running http://localhost:3000 on Safari browser. 
If you face any with connecting to browser, open terminal and run:

```bash
pkill -9 "Chrome"
```
and try again.

If you still face issues, try changing the websocket port from 9222 to 9223 in the `webrover_browser.py` file in the `backend/Browser` folder.
